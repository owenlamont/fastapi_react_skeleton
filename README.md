# fastapi_react_skeleton

This is intended to be a minimal skeleton application demonstrating a FastAPI server both hosting and interacting with a React client. This work is inspired by the [Developing a Single Page App with FastAPI and React](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-react/) tutorial, but I wanted to go a step further and have FastAPI host the React application too.
